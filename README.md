**N.B. This branch is for Awesome v4.3 git. [You can find the branch for Awesome v4.3 stable here](https://github.com/mut-ex/awesome-wm-nice/tree/awesome-4v3-stable)**

nice is an easy to use, highly configurable extension for **[Awesome WM](https://awesomewm.org/)** that adds beautiful window decorations (and extra functionality!) to clients. It...

* ...adds a **subtle 3D look**, and soft, **rounded anti-aliased, corners** to windows
* ...picks the window **decoration color based on the client content for a seamless look** , and adjusts the window title text color accordingly
* ...**auto-generates titlebar buttons** (and their states) for you based on the colors your pick *or* you can let it pick the colors for you!
* ...allows you to customize which titlebar buttons to include, their order, and their layout
* ...adds the **ability to maximize/unmaximize** floating windows by **double clicking the titlebar**, and of course, **moving them by clicking and holding**
* ...adds the ability to **"roll up"** and **"roll down"** the client window like a **window shade**! Scroll up over the titlebar to **instantly hide the window contents but keep the title bar** right where it is. And then either scroll down or click the titlebar to make the window contents visible again!

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites 

* You need **[Awesome WM](https://awesomewm.org/)** with a working basic configuration. **This branch is for Awesome v4.3 git. [You can find the branch for Awesome v4.3 stable here](https://github.com/mut-ex/awesome-wm-nice/tree/awesome-4v3-stable)**

* You also need **[picom](https://github.com/yshui/picom)**. Make sure you have `shadow-ignore-shaped = false` in your configuration otherwise picom will not draw shadows. My recommended shadow settings are given below: 

  ```
  shadow = true;
  shadow-radius = 40;
  shadow-opacity = .55;
  shadow-offset-x = -40;
  shadow-offset-y = -20;
  shadow-exclude = [
    "_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE:a = '_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_NOTIFICATION'",
    "_NET_WM_STATE@:32a *= '_NET_WM_STATE_HIDDEN'",
    "_GTK_FRAME_EXTENTS@:c"
  ];
  shadow-ignore-shaped = false
  ```

* For **GTK** applications add the following line to **~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini** under the **[Settings]** section to hide client-side window control buttons:

 ```
  gtk-decoration-layout=menu:
 ```

* Within you Awesome configuration, make sure that you do not already have code in place that request default titlebars for clients. Something like this:

```lua
client.connect_signal("request::titlebars", function(c) ... end) -- Remove this
```

* Additionally, nice only adds window decorations to clients that have the `titlebars_enabled` property set to true. So configure your client rules accordingly.

### Installation

The easiest and quickest way to get started is by cloning this repository to your awesome configuration directory

```shell
$ cd ~/.config/awesome
$ git clone https://github.com/mut-ex/awesome-wm-nice.git nice
```



## Usage

To use nice, you first need to load the module. To do that, put the following line right after `beautiful.init(...)`

```lua
local nice = require("nice")
nice()
```

If you are fine using the default configuration, you are all done! 

nice will automatically detect and change the window decoration color to match the client. However...

* To pick the window decoration color yourself, right-click the titlebar and select **'Manually Pick Color'**
* To update the window decoration colors, right-click on the titlebar and select **'Redo Window Decorations'**
* Scroll-up with your mouse over the titlebar to "roll up" the window shade. Scroll-down over the titlebar, or left-click to "roll down" the window shade
* nice saves its color rules in the **color_rules** file within the module directory. If you wish you can manually edit it, or delete the file if you want to start again.



## Configuration

You can override the defaults by passing your own configuration. For example

```lua
local nice = require("nice")
nice {
    titlebar_color = "#00ff00",
    
    -- You only need to pass the parameter you are changing
    context_menu_theme = {
        width = 300, 
    },
    
    -- Swap the designated buttons for resizing, and opening the context menu
    mb_resize = nice.MB_MIDDLE,
    mb_contextmenu = nice.MB_RIGHT,
}
```

Below you will find further details explaining the configuration parameters for nice.

## Using

nice will automatically detect and change the window decoration color to match the client. However...

* If nice doesn't pick the right color or you want to specify it yourself, right-click the titlebar and select 'Manually Pick Color'
* If the client theme changes (for example if you change your terminal emulator colors), to update the window decoration colors, right-click on the titlebar and select 'Redo Window Decorations'
* Scroll-up with your mouse over the titlebar to "roll-up" the window shade. Scroll-down over the titlebar, or left-click to "roll-down" the window shade
* nice saves its color rules in the color_rules file within the module directory. If you wish you can manually edit it, or delete the file if you want to start again.
